This program is available as a [calibre

[command-line interface](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FanFicFare) (via
pip), and a [web service](http://fanficfare.appspot.com/).

There's additional info in the project
[wiki](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki) pages.

There's also a [FanFicFare
maillist](https://groups.google.com/group/fanfic-downloader) for
discussion and announcements.
